Here are the Course Outcomes (COs) for your syllabus:

### Design Patterns
**CO1**: Understand the purpose and application of various design patterns.
- **CO1.1**: Identify and apply Creational patterns (Singleton, Factory method, Abstract Factory) to create objects in a flexible and reusable manner.
- **CO1.2**: Use Structural patterns (Decorator, Bridge, Adapter, Facade) to compose classes and objects into larger structures.
- **CO1.3**: Implement Behavioral patterns (Observer, Command, Iterator, Chain of Responsibility, Strategy, Template, Dependency Injection) to manage complex communication and responsibility among objects.

### Clean Coding Techniques
**CO2**: Apply clean coding techniques to improve code quality and maintainability.
- **CO2.1**: Implement SOLID principles to create flexible and maintainable code.
- **CO2.2**: Identify and address code smells such as Bloaters, Object-oriented abusers, Change preventers, Dispensables, and Couplers.
- **CO2.3**: Use refactoring techniques to improve the structure and readability of existing code.

### Test Driven Development (TDD)
**CO3**: Develop and validate code using TDD practices.
- **CO3.1**: Understand the principles and benefits of TDD.
- **CO3.2**: Write unit tests using JUnit5 to validate the functionality of individual components.

### Generics & Collections Framework
**CO4**: Utilize generics and collections framework to handle data structures efficiently.
- **CO4.1**: Apply generics to create type-safe collections and methods.
- **CO4.2**: Implement and manipulate data structures such as stacks, queues, and priority queues using generics.
- **CO4.3**: Use comparator, comparable, cloneable, and iterator interfaces to enhance data handling capabilities.
- **CO4.4**: Leverage sets, maps, functional interfaces, nested classes, lambda expressions, and Stream API for efficient data processing.

### Multi-threading & Parallel Programming
**CO5**: Design and implement multi-threaded and parallel programs.
- **CO5.1**: Understand the concepts of multi-threading and parallel programming.
- **CO5.2**: Create and manage threads, thread classes, and thread pools.
- **CO5.3**: Apply thread synchronization and locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety.
- **CO5.4**: Implement cooperation among threads using case studies like the Producer/Consumer problem.
- **CO5.5**: Utilize advanced techniques such as blocking queues, semaphores, deadlock avoidance, and synchronized collections for efficient parallel programming.

### Java I/O and JDBC
**CO6**: Perform input/output operations and connect to databases using JDBC.
- **CO6.1**: Understand the limitations and capabilities of Java I/O.
- **CO6.2**: Connect to and interact with databases using JDBC.
- **CO6.3**: Implement JDBC components and architecture in 2-tier and 3-tier applications.
- **CO6.4**: Establish and manage database connections, particularly with PostgreSQL.

### Servlets and JSP
**CO7**: Develop web applications using Servlets and JSP.
- **CO7.1**: Understand the lifecycle, attributes, and interaction between clients and servlets.
- **CO7.2**: Create and manage servlet-based web applications.
- **CO7.3**: Understand the advantages and features of JSP over servlets.
- **CO7.4**: Develop JSP applications, including environmental setup, syntax, lifecycle, and client-server interaction.

These COs provide clear and measurable objectives for your course, ensuring you gain the necessary skills and knowledge in advanced object-oriented programming and Java development.
